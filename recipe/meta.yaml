  summary: A python toolkit for modeling earth surface processes
  description: |
    Landlab creates an environment in which scientists can build
    a numerical landscape model without having to code all of the
    individual components. Landscape models compute flows of mass,
    such as water, sediment, glacial ice, volcanic material, or
    landslide debris, across a gridded terrain surface. Landscape
    models have a number of commonalities, such as operating on a
    grid of points and routing material across the grid. Scientists
    who want to use a landscape model often build their own unique
    model from the ground up, re-coding the basic building blocks
    of their landscape model rather than taking advantage of codes
    that have already been written.
